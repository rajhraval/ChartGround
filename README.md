# ChartGround
Exploring Swift Charts

## Why I made it?
This is an initiative to learn and explore about the Swift Charts Framework and as I wanted to do something and not sit idle and be lazy.

### Phase 0 
- [x] - Explore all 6 Chart types
- [x] - Open-source the project and give an update

### Phase 1
- [ ] - Exploring a single chart 
- [ ] - Coming soon.

### Want to contribute?
Well, as of now I have no prior experience of handling an open-source project, well it might the first one (If this works out well :grimacing:), but I will create a Contributing.md soon.

If you have any suggestions or feedbacks, do reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rajhraval) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajhraval/).

Till then Happy Learning!
